# PROJECT ARDUINO - GENIUS #


First Arduino project made by me, **Eduardo Carreiro**. 

I was take advantge to learn Arduino and Git / GitHub in the same time.

I am eletronic engineer, graduated in 1998. But at that time, learn electronics was not so easy as today  :camel: .

I will make improvements, like to add a 7-segment display, improve sound and other stuffs.
